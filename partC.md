a. Open loop Control is independent of the process output.  Open Loop Odometry is dependent on the control of the process.
When there are no variations in the system and the input required to earn the desired output is known, an open loop system
is optimal.  However, if there are variations in the system including unexpected obstacles, an open loop system is unreliable.

c. There are dramtic jumps when the robot is changing its legs of travel.  They occur because the robot is not gradually changing
its orientation to switch legs.

d.  It has a small impact in this setting since there are not many sensors feeding information to the system in the measurement update phase.
In a system where there are multiple sensors giving information to the filter, the filter performance would be affected.
